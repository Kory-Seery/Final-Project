# Chillz

# About

This project started off an idea for introverts to get out of their comfort zone and live a little. 

This site shows people how to have a little harmless fun and to make human connections that can possibly grow over time. In our everyday life we focus too much on what others think and lose touch with our own life, this site ensures that no matter what you do you aren't alone.

### Why

Why this title: The title "Chillz" came from the word chill for the fact that the site should be relaxing and fun. The z in the title makes it sound like a cold theme that the users need to use to warm up to the idea of getting out of their comfort zone.

Why this slogan: The slogan pretty much describes what was the main idea behind the site, hence the slogan "Live a Little".

Why this style: The theme mostly came with the idea of the title making it Chillz made it feel cold and comfy. The color blue matched the aspect of the cold with the title but also made it feel cozy enough to make it classy.

Why Mood system: The mood system was make it feel more as if people connect with each others through mutual emotions.

#### Explaination

I established my pages into components and implemented them all into a navigation bar on the web page, I did this to facilitate focus per page and make it more accessible and pleasant.

I used router, routes, route from react-router-dom to link all my components together on the app.js file.

On Sign-in, Sign-up and Recommend component I created a form to make the user feel like they can easily use the site for what they need. I implied rest practices while following CRUD principles for better funtionnality.

I made sure to style all my work with styled compontents this allows me to go through my code and view it more clearly in the event that i would need to modify any little aspect of the Chillz in the future wether by adding or removing content.

The profile page was a way to make it more interactive with the user and can show a bit more about the user. Hopefully in the future users could be able to log-in and go to each others profiles to see common likes and dislikes.

I created a desktop first approach for Chillz because that is what i am most familliar with and i believe as a web developer desktop websites are more likely to be viewed on a computer/Laptop then on any other device, although i did love creating a website i could see through multiple different platforms.

For easier accessibility for the user i made the navigation bar on the main pages of the site and made it so it follows the user on whichever page they are interessted by and also remains at the top of the screen on any of the pages for easier access at anytime the user needs or wants.
